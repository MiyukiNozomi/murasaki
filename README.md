An Attempt to write my own Browser Engine in D!
it sounds stupid, but i actually began writing it
so... you're too late to stop me now.

Of course, currently it only supports parsing, but in the future i'll try to code my own
javascript engine which is definitally going to be something extra hard.

i want to reach a point in which i can at least open a github page on it.

the UI of this thing is planned to be made nativaly with OpenGL.
